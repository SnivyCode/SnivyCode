## SnivyCode
*Also known as FlySnivy, SnivellingTree6*

I'm Luca, I come from Italy, and I consider myself a front-end developer, with some interest in back-end development too.
Not just a coder, but also an aviation enthusiast from a very young age. <br>
During my adolescence I developed a passion for computer science, which led me to study programming languages and enroll in high school computer science, all mixed up with aviation as well.<br>
I also love graphics design, I like designing User Interfaces (UI) according with the User Experiences (UX).
