### SnivyCode

Hello, I'm Snivy, I come from Italy, I'm an aviation enthusiast from a very young age, but during my adolescence I also developed a passion for computer science, which led me to study programming languages and enroll in high school computer science.
I also love graphics design, infact I can design User Interfaces (UI) according with the User Experience (UX)
